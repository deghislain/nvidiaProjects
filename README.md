The authenticator_bot app is a compact tool designed to streamline system authentication. 
This project explores alternatives to traditional username and password methods, 
aiming to leverage generative AI to potentially eliminate the need for these credentials.

The authentication process with authenticator_bot involves the following steps:

    Image Verification: Capture the userâ€™s image using a camera and compare it with a pre-stored image to confirm identity.
    Code Verification: Send a verification code to the user through an alternative device, such as a mobile phone or email.
    Voice Verification: Request the user to repeat a specific sentence and compare its voice to a stored voice sample.
    Fingerprint Verification: When available, prompt the user to provide a fingerprint via a laptop's fingerprint sensor.

Access is granted only upon the successful completion of all these steps.
